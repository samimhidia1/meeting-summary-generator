- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add inline comments to explain complex logic.

## 2. Optimize Algorithms and Data Structures for Efficiency
- Review and optimize the performance of key algorithms.
- Use appropriate data structures for better performance.

## 3. Ensure Secure Handling of Sensitive Data
- Use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the codebase.

## 4. Improve Error Handling and User Feedback
- Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
- Provide clear and informative error messages to users.

## 5. Implement a Robust Logging System
- Replace print statements with logging calls.
- Use different logging levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) for better monitoring.

## 6. Increase Test Coverage
- Add unit tests for all major functions and modules.
- Cover edge cases and different scenarios in the tests.

## 7. Enhance Inline Comments and Documentation
- Add inline comments to explain the purpose of code blocks.
- Update the documentation to reflect recent changes and improvements.

## 8. Update and Manage Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions.
- Use tools like `pip-tools` to manage dependencies and avoid security vulnerabilities.

## 9. Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Use tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI for continuous integration.

## 10. Enforce a Consistent Code Style
- Use tools like `flake8` or `black` to enforce a consistent code style.
- Add a pre-commit hook to automatically format code before committing.
